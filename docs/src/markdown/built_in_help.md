This is short built-in help page covering only the basic usage of the calculator. Please visit the online [user documentation](https://github.com) for more detailed overview of features and capabilities of this app.

## Functionality and Capabilities
Supported operations:
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- factorial
- power (nat exp)
- root
- logarithm

This application also supports brackets and calculation of nested expressions.

Supported bracket types:
- `( )`
- `[ ]`
- `{ }`

For advanced function calls only `( )` brackets can be used.

The built-in constants are the number *pi* and *eulers* number.

## Quick overview
When launched the application consists of three main parts (Top to Bottom):
- The top bar with the menu icon, leading to the menu.
- A panel with input and results field as well as history container.
- Panel of basic operations.
- Button for switching between the basic and advanced operations panels.

### Menu
After clicking on the menu icon a menu with the following options is displayed:
- **About** - shows basic info abou the app
- **Help**  - shows this help page
- **User Documentation** - link to website with the user documentation
- **Clear history** - button that removes all records from the history of calculations

### Input, Results and History
- Just above the panel with operations there is an input field for insertion of expressions.
- Above it resides a history and results panel. The last result is always viewed at the bottom. The results panel is also used for display of errors.
- The panel of basic (and advanced) operations allows the user to easily insert mathematical expressions into the input field.


## Input
The calculator accepts inputs from the operations panels and from keyboard.
If for any reason you can not input by typing on the keyboard, try clicking into the input field once.

All the buttons from panels and keyboard inputs insert at the position of your cursor in the input panel. To move the cursor use either arrow keys or your mouse.

Buttons for advanced operations (power, root and logarithm) always reposition your cursor to the place where the input number for the given operation is expected. Feel free to change the exponents or bases of these operations changing the default inserted value.

## Supported Input Syntax
Calculator supports nested brackets and functions. Additional spaces are ommited.

Syntax of operations:

Operation | Syntax | Example
--- | --- | ---
add | x + y | 1 + 2
sub | x - y | 2 - 1
mul | x * y | 3 * 6
div | x / y | 2 * 42
pow | x^y | 2^2
root | root(base, exp) | root(4, 2)
fac | x! | 6|
log | log(base, value) | log(10, 100)

The brackets must be closed with the same type. For functions only `()` brackets can be used.
If you want to add a sub expression into a function call you must enclose with brackets. More [at](#example-usage).

Constants:
- ***Pi*** - as `pi`, `Ï€`, `Pi` or `PI`
- ***E*** - as `Eu`, `eu` or `EU`

## Example usage
A table with valid inputs with solutions:

Input | Result
--- | ---
(2*3)-(4/2) | 4
2*(3*(10+2)) | 72
1.6*2 | 3.25808
2^2 | 4
root(16, 2) | 4
log(10, 100) | 2
10! | 3628800
log(10, (10^2)) | 2
2*root((log(10, (4+6))+15), 2) | 8

## Usage tips
- The buttons that insert the power operator `^` are context aware
